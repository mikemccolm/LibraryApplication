The database was constructed using Google's real time Firebase database.
There are two tables used, Work and Book.
Work represents a writing of a book, (i.e. Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, Great Gatsby)
Book represents a physcial copy of a book, and is given a unique ID.
The two pictures in this directory show the schema using examples I created.

Additionally, I've made the database publicly accessible for convenience, it should be able to be accessed by the following link:
